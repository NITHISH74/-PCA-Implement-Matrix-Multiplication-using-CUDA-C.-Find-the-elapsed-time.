# EX-05-PCA-Implement-Matrix-Multiplication-using-CUDA-C.-Find-the-elapsed-time. Implement Matrix Multiplication using GPU.
## Aim:
To implement matrix multiplication using GPU.


## Procedure:
### Step 1: 
Define constants and variables, including matrix sizes and device memory pointers.

### Step 2: 
Initialize matrices and allocate GPU memory.

### Step 3: 
Copy input matrices from host to device.

### Step 4: 
Set grid and block dimensions, launch the kernel function, and copy the result matrix from device to host.

### Step 5: 
Measure elapsed time, print the result matrix and elapsed time, and free device memory.

### Step 6: 
Terminate the program. 
## Output:
```cuda

```
## Result:
Thus, the program to implement matrix multiplication using the GPU has been successfully executed.
